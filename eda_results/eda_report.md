# MIMIC-IV Clinical AI System - EDA Report

**Generated:** 2026-01-13 14:15:33

## Executive Summary

This report presents an exploratory data analysis of the MIMIC-IV dataset 
for the Clinical AI System implementing Phase 1 (Digital Twin Sandbox) 
and Phase 2 (Safety Layer).

---

## Dataset Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Patients | 42,951 |
| Total Admissions | 166,062 |
| In-Hospital Mortality | 4.3% |
| Median LOS | 4.2 days |

---

## Clinical Data Volume

| Data Type | Records | Per Patient |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Chart Events | 795,956 | 3618 |
| Prescriptions | 10,538,716 | 246 |

---

## Time Gap Analysis (Critical for Digital Twin)

The irregular time intervals between clinical measurements are essential for 
the Liquid Neural Network architecture used in the Digital Twin model.

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Mean Δt | 2.9 minutes |
| Median Δt | 0.0 minutes |
| Std Δt | 16.5 minutes |

## Key Findings

### Phase 1 Implications (Digital Twin)

1. **Irregular Sampling**: High variance in time gaps confirms the need for 
   adaptive time constant modeling (τ adaptation in Liquid cells)

2. **Rich Feature Space**: Comprehensive vital signs and lab data support 
   multi-trajectory uncertainty quantification

3. **Patient Heterogeneity**: Wide variation in measurements per patient 
   requires robust sequence padding/masking

### Phase 2 Implications (Safety Layer)

1. **Medication Data**: 6,817 unique drugs available 
   for contraindication rule mining

2. **Vasopressor Usage**: 24,613 patients received 
   vasopressors - useful for outcome definition

3. **Missing Data**: Missingness patterns inform feature engineering and 
   imputation strategies
