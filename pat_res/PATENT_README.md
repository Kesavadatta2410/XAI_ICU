## Clinical Decision Support System with Safety-Aware AI

### Novel Mechanism 1: Safety Layer Override

The system implements a **novel "Safety Layer Override"** mechanism that combines neural network predictions with hard clinical rules. This represents a non-obvious improvement over:
- Pure ML systems (which lack clinical safety guarantees)
- Pure rule-based systems (which lack adaptive learning capability)

**How it works:**

1. The Liquid Neural Network generates a mortality risk prediction with uncertainty
2. The Safety Layer evaluates the prediction against a knowledge base of medical rules
3. If clinical safety rules are violated, the Safety Layer **overrides** the ML prediction

**Patent Claim Language:**
> "The system of claim X wherein the safety module overrides the neural network 
> prediction when one or more of the following conditions are detected:
> (a) Blood glucose level below 70 mg/dL indicating hypoglycemia;
> (b) Blood glucose level above 400 mg/dL indicating severe hyperglycemia;
> (c) Blood glucose level above 250 mg/dL AND bicarbonate level below 18 mEq/L 
>     indicating diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA);
> wherein said override ensures clinically safe recommendations regardless of
> the neural network's output."

### Novel Mechanism 2: Digital Twin with MC Dropout

The system implements a **Digital Twin** concept using Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout for uncertainty quantification:

**Implementation Details:**
- During inference, dropout layers remain active
- Each patient simulation runs N=20 forward passes
- The variance across runs estimates **epistemic uncertainty**
- 95% confidence intervals computed as: mean ± 1.96 × std

**Patent Claim Language:**
> "The system of claim Y wherein the uncertainty quantification module comprises:
> (a) A dropout mechanism with probability p maintained during inference;
> (b) A Monte Carlo sampling procedure executing N stochastic forward passes;
> (c) A confidence interval calculator producing 95% bounds on the risk estimate;
> wherein said uncertainty estimate enables identification of cases requiring
> additional clinical review."

### Novel Mechanism 3: Counterfactual Diffusion Model

The system includes a **Conditional Diffusion Model** for generating counterfactual patient trajectories:

**Purpose:** Answer "what-if" questions for intervention planning
**Method:** Denoising diffusion with physiological constraints
**Output:** Clinically plausible alternative trajectories showing how intervention X would affect outcome Y

**Patent Claim Language:**
> "The system of claim Z wherein the explanation generator comprises:
> (a) A conditional diffusion model trained on patient trajectories;
> (b) A physiological constraint module ensuring generated trajectories remain
>     within clinically valid bounds;
> (c) A counterfactual generator that produces alternative patient states
>     conditioned on hypothetical interventions."
